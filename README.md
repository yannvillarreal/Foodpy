# Foodpy
An application I want to develop to practice my new python skills.

First goals:
- Allow creation of users
- Get a list of products and their information (name, amount, expiration date)
- Get information of how much of every product is eaten per period of time
- Make a database based on the information received
- Estimate remaining time to buy next product on the list

Future features:
- Get diet information (calories, fats, protein, salts and carbohydrates per day)
- Calculate costs (expenses per day, week, month, year)
- Add a new product to a pre-established diet in order to consider "cheats"
- Count days in which diet has been followed
